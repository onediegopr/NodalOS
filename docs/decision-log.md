# NODAL OS Decision Log

## POST_PHASE_E_NEXT_ROADMAP_DECISION_READ_ONLY

- Decision target: `GO_POST_PHASE_E_NEXT_ROADMAP_DECISION_READ_ONLY_READY`
- Status: accepted as read-only roadmap decision.
- Input: Phase E formal closeout at `af0e14440265ce8c85a212e04670b22339daf64e`.
- Recommendation: `READ_ONLY_CROSS_PHASE_CLOSEOUT_INDEX`.
- Reason: Phase C, Phase D and Phase E have closed as read-only/no-runtime tracks; a global index should preserve traceability before any UI polish or design-only execution planning.
- Non-goals: no execution, mutation, runtime, physical export, provider/cloud, DB, semantic/vector, LLM, durable memory, product UI actions or release/commercial readiness claim.

## READ_ONLY_CROSS_PHASE_CLOSEOUT_INDEX

- Decision target: `GO_READ_ONLY_CROSS_PHASE_CLOSEOUT_INDEX_READY`
- Status: accepted as documentation-only cross-phase index if validation passes.
- Input: post-Phase-E roadmap decision at `2b91f5e623c3280568039a750a2ebedeef2292aa`.
- Scope: consolidate Phase A/B/C/D/E milestones, commits, artifacts, capability status, no-side-effect proof, protected scope proof and open debt.
- Recommendation after index: `MIGRATION_READ_ONLY_FINAL_AUDIT_PACK`, or `PAUSE_NODAL_OS_AND_RETURN_TO_OTHER_PROJECT` if project focus changes.
- Reason: Phase C, Phase D and Phase E are closed as read-only/no-runtime tracks; the index preserves traceability before any later audit pack, UI polish or protected design-only planning.
- Non-goals: no execution, mutation, runtime, physical export, clipboard, download, provider/cloud, DB, semantic/vector, LLM, durable memory, product UI actions or release/commercial readiness claim.

## MIGRATION_READ_ONLY_FINAL_AUDIT_PACK

- Decision target: `GO_MIGRATION_READ_ONLY_FINAL_AUDIT_PACK_READY`
- Status: accepted as documentation-only final audit pack if validation passes.
- Input: cross-phase closeout index at `14e0084a50539c330d1bce58e395db3bc1feed67`.
- Source of truth: `docs/roadmap/read-only-cross-phase-closeout-index.md`.
- Scope: final internal migration/read-only audit pack with phase status, migration boundary, exclusions, capability matrix, audit evidence map, validation plan, pause-ready handoff and next prompt options.
- Recommendation after pack: `MIGRATION_READ_ONLY_FINAL_EXTERNAL_AUDIT` if continuing NODAL OS, or `PAUSE_NODAL_OS_AND_RETURN_TO_NODRIX` if switching project line.
- Non-goals: no execution, mutation, runtime, physical export, clipboard, download, workspace scan, provider/cloud, DB, semantic/vector, LLM, durable memory, product UI actions or release/commercial readiness claim.

## PAUSE_NODAL_OS_AND_RETURN_TO_NODRIX

- Decision target: `GO_PAUSE_NODAL_OS_AND_RETURN_TO_NODRIX_READY`
- Status: accepted as docs-only pause handoff if validation passes.
- Input: migration/read-only final audit pack at `1b0c797d6f8059bb40a2ccf6fd10555116a17ad5`.
- Final pause/resume HEAD: `16cb752a3bda4e3e71090d7299f68a0d6e0462cb`.
- Cross-phase source-index commit: `14e0084a50539c330d1bce58e395db3bc1feed67`.
- External audit: `CLAUDE_MIGRATION_READ_ONLY_FINAL_AUDIT_GO` on HEAD `1b0c797d6f8059bb40a2ccf6fd10555116a17ad5`.
- Pause status: `PAUSED_SAFE_READ_ONLY_NO_RUNTIME`.
- Scope: final NODAL OS pause handoff, QA report and NODRIX return prompt.
- Next project recommendation: return to NODRIX from its own repo/branch/roadmap without mixing NODAL OS state.
- Non-goals: no execution, mutation, runtime, physical export, clipboard, download, workspace scan, provider/cloud, DB, semantic/vector, LLM, durable memory, product UI actions or release/commercial readiness claim.

## NODAL_OS_VISIBLE_APPROVAL_SURFACE_POLISH_AUDIT_SAFE

- Decision target: `GO_NODAL_OS_VISIBLE_APPROVAL_SURFACE_POLISH_AUDIT_SAFE_READY`

- Scope: improve Approval Packet and Human Review Packet preview wording, grouping, disabled notices, label-only decision copy and no-side-effect handoff wording.
- Non-goals: no execution, mutation, runtime, physical export, clipboard, download, workspace scan, provider/cloud, DB, semantic/vector, LLM, durable memory, product UI actions or release/commercial readiness claim.
- Next safe options: protected design-only approval execution planning, or pause again after the visible polish.

## NODAL_OS_APPROVAL_EXECUTION_DESIGN_ONLY_PROTECTED

- Non-goals: no execution, mutation, runtime, physical export, clipboard, download, filesystem product IO, workspace scan, provider/cloud, DB, semantic/vector, LLM, durable memory, product UI actions, service registration or release/commercial readiness claim.
- Next safe options: external audit of the design-only contract, or pause again.
